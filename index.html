                Hello, my name is Alex Stone, and I have a hobbyist software developer.
                I am fourteen years old right now, and I am always learning; I hope to 
                always improve myself and aspire to be better. Some of my other passtimes
                are building lego creations, playing video games, learning about history, 
                having fun with friends, and making new friends with random people.

            <p>
                I have been writing code for about four years, and I have learned a lot of things along the way.
                Some of the things that I know are how to program in C, Python, Javascript, and Java. I am 
                currently working on imporving my Rust and C++ programming skills as well as learning more
                about different Javascript frameworks.

            <p>
                I have worked on more applications, libraries, and tests then I could ever remember, but if you
                would like to see some of my more recent projects then you can see them on my github page.
